Instead, what I focus on is how to make each rep as hard as possible.\n\nThis is why for example I don’t count a pull up unless I go chest to bar, in a smooth and controlled tempo while capitalizing maximum muscle-tension through mind to muscle cues.\n\nTIP #4️⃣: DO IT EVERY DAY\nInstead of trying to cram a lot of mediocre sets in two or three workouts, I only focus on quality sets that are spread optimally across the week.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO!\nTo watch the whole video and understand everything in a lot more depth, make sure you watch the whole thing on YouTube.\n\n[GET YOUR FREE BEGINNER'S GUIDE] http://www.bodyweightmuscle.com/free-beginners-guide/\n===================================\nRecommended Gymnastic Rings ◎◎: https://www.bodyweightmuscle.com/recommended-gymnastic-rings/\n===================================\nOTHER BOOKS (Beginner and Intermediate):\n- All you Need is Pull-up Bar (My Story): \n- How to sculpt a Greek God Marble Chest with Push-ups\n- How to Carve a Gymnast's Ripped Back with Pull-Ups:\n- Easy Weight-Loss] Lose weight with 30 easy tips\nFind them all here; http://www.bodyweightmuscle.com/free-beginners-guide/\n===================================\nADVANCED HOME-WORKOUT PLAN:\nSuperhero Bodyweight-Workout: http://www.superherobodyweightworkout.com\n===================================\nMy favorite Jump-rope: https://www.bodyweightmuscle.com/crossrope \n===================================\nFollow me on INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/bodyweightmuscle\n===================================\nDisclaimer:\nAll information in this YouTube channel is presented with good intentions.

By the way you can find tutorials and helpful links about all the extra things I’m mentioning in the description and the top pinned comment below. \n\nMy favorite and recommended choice here are chest to bar pull-ups. \n\nSo after your minute of rest ends, move to part two and five rounds of  \n\nExample:\n\n1.

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\nChoosing Friends\n\nThis video is going to offend some people. It is broken into two parts, most will eventually pass through part one however, part two is the next step.\n\nThe Basics\nMost guys, girls included, have many “friends“. These people are holding you back. They are dragging you down. You’re being suffocated as you stand in your comfort zone unable to venture out alone. Each day you’re\ndying because stagnation is death. Your friends are your worst enemies. It is never what we don’t know that gets us in trouble it is always what we believe to be true that isn’t so. So ask yourself. Are your friends worth your time?\n\nFor most people, the answer to the question above is no. Your friends are creating a negative feedback loop in your mind when it should be a positive feedback loop. If you’re on the fence here’s a cut and dry guide to sifting through your 500K friends.\n\nDoes this person encourage you to “just be yourself”? Yes? Next.\nDoes this person have a flash of happiness when you tell him bad news about your work or personal life? Yes? Next.\nDoes this person laugh at you if you get shut down at a bar or club? Yes? Next.\nDoes this person have a negative or “realistic” mindset? Yes? Next.\nDoes this person have a dwindling bank account with no actionable steps to improve his life? Yes? Next.\n\nIn this day and age, the word friendship is dead, we are busy trying to “get ours” with no effort. Instead, replace friendship with the word reciprocity.\n\nA reciprocal relationship is beneficial to both parties. If your best friend is\ndragging you away from events you wish to attend and is willing to battle with you for an obscure girl at a club, be certain he won’t be there for you when you need a place to crash.\n\nAdvancement in Seven Steps\n\nAssuming you’ve built up a solid social circle and none of your friends is an outright loser, it’s time to step up to the next level. Building upon some of these key elements will take years to achieve.\n\nFaith: A key element to giving yourself unbreakable confidence is faith. While you may or may not be religious yourself, befriending a man/woman that has the exact opposite religious beliefs could do wonders for both you and your new friend.\n\nEthnicity: Unless you are in an odd city with no diversity, befriending a set of people from various backgrounds will open your mind to new ways of thinking.\n\nWillpower: Someone has had it harder than you. Someone has had it harder than us. Someone always overcame more. Consistently search for a man who has overcome more in his life than you have… and succeeded. This will make it incrementally more difficult to look in the mirror and say “I quit”.\n\nMoney: You must have a close friend who is wealthy. The wealthier the better. Osmosis will occur. More importantly, how does an average person obtain contact with a wealthy individual? You must add value to their life. This is how rich people think.\n\nHard Work: Similar to willpower, you must find a person who works harder than you do. It is much easier to simply state “I work hard”. This is what lazy people do. They say they work hard but can’t tell you what they did over the last 24 hours. You should have an hour-by-hour breakdown of what you did and why. This should be trumped by someone you deem as superior to you.\n\nPositivity: The impossibly bubbly kind. Where no matter what happens in life the person will not be phased. Not the slightest. No sleep? No problem. Lost a job? Getting another one. Got burned by a girl? Out picking up girls that night. Family member dies? You never knew because it never came up. Broke a bone? Miraculously fast recovery.\n\nHealth: Always ahead of the curve. Knows the ins and outs of new healthcare technology. Always looking for more information and is in incredibly good health. No one steps in his way because he’s a rock. No one questions his advice because he is living proof. Simply ahead of his time, which is something you can never get back.\n\nWith all of that said. How many of these seven traits do you possess? Or are you the friend that deserves to be cut off?\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS #ChoosingFriends"

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\nCollege and Education \n\nCollege is in fact a scam. No way to say it nicely. The whole scam is as follows: \n1) you need to get a degree to prove you are smart, \n2) they make sure it is easier for rich people to get accepted into the colleges that matter, \n3) they make sure everyone has to take on debt to pay for this “education” if they can’t afford it and \n4) you have to pay back the debt even if the education doesn’t help you make any money in the future. \n\n“But without the degree you wouldn’t get a job at Goldman Sachs/Google etc.”\n\nThis is horrendous logic. All you’re saying is that the system is in fact a scam. If you didn’t actually learn anything useful at the college then why was the degree required in the first place?!?! Requiring a degree from an “elite college” does nothing but perpetuate the scam. If you can sell/generate revenue for the firm, it shouldn’t matter if you went to college in the first place. \n\n#1 Play The Game: With that aside, instead of complaining about the rules of the game, you want to maximize it in your favor. This means you should write your admissions essays to fit the narratives. It means you should apply to majors that are easier to get into and switch. So on and so forth. Look into all the rules and make sure you’re putting yourself in the best possible position to gain admission.\n\n#2 Choosing the System: If you have 3-4 options, go to the career website. Do not ask your friends for “opinions”. Go onto the career website for each school or ask for the info on who recruits at the university. If there is no difference in employment options choose the one with the lowest cost.\n\n#3 Maximize the System: Once in the system, your goal is to get an A- average or so. The general cutoff for most good paying positions is a 3.5 GPA. A good way to boost your GPA is by taking community college classes during the summer of your freshman year or into your sophomore year.\n\n#4 Get Into Your Field ASAP: Anyone who works for a living will choose the guy with a 3.5 GPA and 3-4 internships over the guy with a 4.0 and zero work experience.\n\n#5 Take The Easiest Professors: Every college has some sort of system to rank each professor. Choose the ones with the most lenient grading averages and the easiest content.\n\n#6 Begin the Side Hustles:\nSince you’re efficient with your time, you should spend at least part of it learning the basics of online sales. It could be anything from copywriting to learning basic website design in the future. You could even start an online tutoring business for a few extra bucks just to learn how to build the website and get some customers. \n\n#7 Don’t Blow All of Your Time Partying: You can go ahead and party here and there just don’t let College be the “peak” of your life. When you become successful you’ll find that every single year after age 25 or so is pretty much a new peak.\n\n#8 Skip it All: Another fun idea is to simply skip all of this stuff. You can go to Hack Reactor or other coding schools and side step the college system if you’re a savvy tech person. If you can go straight to a top company without the four year degree process or start a business without college you’re good to go. No doubt about it. \n\nIn the end, you should become more optimistic. In your 20s and even 30s, you have a ton of energy. There is no need to take your foot off the gas as you can use it to build a bigger base/foundation. The future is brighter than it has ever been before and you can de-risk your future while simultaneously increasing your income. It is a no brainer!\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS"

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\n#1 Think Ahead: If you have no money, you have to plan ahead. This means you can look into the following: 1) credit card reward churning, 2) gift card discount purchasing, 3) bank account opening churning and 4) quick resells of holiday goods - such as Xbox/Playstation consoles and other popular products. These four things alone are *not* going to make you rich. What they will do is add a few thousand US tokens for you per year.\n\n#2 Reduce Overhead on Day One: On day one, with nothing, you want to keep the overhead as low as possible. Reduce rent expenses to as low as humanly possible.\n\n#3 Gather 3-6 Months Living Expense: Living Expenses = monthly rent payment + food + utilities + healthcare cost. \nThere is really no situation where you want to have less than 3-6 months in emergency money. Anything can happen. \n\n#4 All Company Matches: This one should be obvious but you should take the Company match (practically no exceptions). This has nothing to do with crypto or stocks or bonds. It has to do with math. If you get a company match that is a 100% return on day one! There is no way to beat that.\n\n#5 Move into Crypto: At this point this would be the third investment idea (our opinion). Don’t buy high-risk small caps. \nThis third level assumes the following: 1) you’re already working on a secondary form of income and 2) you do not have any upcoming liabilities to take care of.\n\n#6 Calculated Risk: At this point, you should have various directions. You should be flooded with options. Unlike “Jugglers” people who work on 10-15 projects at the same time (none of them work), you have 2-3 income streams and know that there are options for you: 1) go with product A, 2) sell company go with idea B or 3) continue to scale current income streams and invest into crypto/stocks/buy your first residence.\n\n#7 Real Estate: Pretty big change. Before we had real estate as a wealth creation vehicle but that has changed. You’re free to do whatever you like. In our opinion, you’re better off just having one place to live (home/apartment) and no other real estate exposure.\n\n#8 Financially Independent: Once all of your passive income is generating more than your living expenses, you’re free. There isn’t much advice to give at this point. You simply don’t touch the passive income savings/nugget. This prevents you from taking too much risk and allows you to do whatever you like with all of your future earnings. No one is going to get to financial independence and suddenly “quit” the business. It doesn’t work like that. \n\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS #PersonalFinance"

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\nSeveral of you are new and are looking for ways to earn the most amount of money with the least amount of effort (in a career or job). We’re going to update everyone on the way we’d execute the strategy if we had to start over in 2021. As usual. We can give you the blueprint, but we can’t execute for you.\n\nChoosing the Career/Job:\nIf you cannot find a role in something that allows you to work from home… you’re going to fall behind. The only reason to show up to some sort of office is that you desperately need the money. In almost all circumstances we’d choose a position that is remote.\n\nGetting the Career/Job:\nEmployers are risk *averse*. They will choose the person who is most likely to not screw it up. They want someone to simply show up and require the least amount of training and do their jobs good enough on day one.\n\nGet The Resume Ready:\nKnowing this you want your resume to be one page in length. That is it. Also. Convert it to PDF. If you were in school, the first thing to show up should be your school name. If you already have work experience, you want to put education at the bottom of the resume and move all work experience to the top, just below the header. Experience wins when comparing a 4.0 GPA student to even a 3.4 GPA student.\n\nNetworking/Career Events: \nNetworking and career events are not really “networking”. It is more like a sales funnel where people show up to get their faces seen. If you simply send resumes into Human Resources, they will miss a good 90% of the candidates.\n\nGet Through The Interview: \nThe entire interview process is essentially the same thing “What do they want to hear”. You simply need to put yourself in their shoes and sell yourself in a way that implies “less headache if you choose me”.\n\nImpress the Winners First: \nIf you are the new guy on the team you do *not* want to become friends with every single person above you in the pecking order. You want to be well-liked by the guys bringing in the most money.\n\nHow to Impress: \nWhile you may think it is all about work quality, it isn’t. You want to make the person “feel good” around you. Start by doing everything absolutely perfectly and you will find out that your work is basically the same as the person sitting next to you. The next step is just to feed the ego. Everything he/she does is “gold” and you’re always impressed by them. So on and so forth.\n\nAbout Six Months:\nIt takes about six months to put in a solid foundation. After that, you should take your foot off the gas a bit and simply maintain your good standing with the winners at the firm.\n\nEnough to Get Promoted: \nAt the lower levels, the only effort you need to put in is “just enough” to get promoted.\n\nSteps to gaming the system: 1) focus on relevant experience and make sure your grades are good enough 3.5 GPA, 2) to make sure it is roughly there, 3) get the position and play politics to get ahead, 4) at your mid-year review if you’re in the top group, you’ve done enough, 5) being #1 just means you’re doing too much and are being abused, 6) start ramping up your side income, 7) if you do make it to a revenue-generating role where you’re heavily incentivized the game gets trickier… Ideally that doesn’t happen to you.\n\nAt this point you should be doing just enough to be seen as a top performer but spending all of your time building up another income stream. This is where patience and effort is required.\n\nEveryone asks us “how long until I make tons of money and can leave!” the answer is cold-blooded “depends on how smart/talented you are”. Some people can get to 2x their annual income within a year or two! Other take 5-6 years and 90%+ just give up since it isn’t easy. To be clear. The 3-4 year metric assumes you’re pretty talented and will only quit if you are making 2x your career income. You *never* quit until you’re making at least double from your business line.\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS"

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\nThis video focused primarily on income and dating. If you are extremely handsome “a male 10” or have extremely high status in an area (DJ, Musician, etc.) then you can certainly break these rules. The overall premise, however, is the same. If you can spend 1.5x the median wage in your city (not save but spend on experiences) then you will have no problems dating in the 7 range. If you can get into the 5x median range and are in shape with solid social skills, you’re going to be sending girls into voice-mail consistently.\n\n– For a 7: ~1.0-1.5x median wage ; For an 8: ~3-4.5x median wage; For a 9: 5.0x+ median wage\n\n– If you cannot find a way to date attractive girls while spending 3x+ the median wage in your city, the problem is personal. You should be able to obtain dates easily by having better ideas, better venues (concerts, major events, private parties, charity events) and better logistics\n\n– As you get older, girls expect you to make more money. When you’re young take advantage of this and prepare for the future. By 30 you should be at or above the median in spending power (bare minimum).\n\n– “As long as you have two commas in your bank account you will always be a seven”\n\n– If she can’t experience it, it does not exist. If your net worth is in the 8 figure range but you live in an RV and dress like a slob, no one will care.\n\n– Location matters a lot for 1) determining median income, 2) potential upside in terms of experiences and 3) your ability to leverage your income to *your advantage*\n\n– Money can improve your looks, it can improve your status (calculate the relative value of people at the venue) and it can even improve your social skills as you should feel much more confident in your personal value\n\n– Dating and *life in general* is a positively skewed bell curve. Roughly 80% of people are below average. This is simply a harsh truth.\n\n– Anyone who claims that money is irrelevant is simply rationalizing or is extremely young (has not seen the wealth impact yet). If they are in their 20s, they don’t know whats going to happen when the inflection point hits (around 30) and the long-term pain will come (40+).\n\n– Avoid people who attempt to rationalize their poor decisions.\n\n– Here is the “median” for the other three categories: Looks: you are about 5’8″. You are roughly 13-15% body fat. You are not fat or skinny or ripped. You know how to wear appropriate fitting clothes. You look better with a shirt on than a shirt off at the beach.\n\nGame: you don’t have social anxiety issues. You can spark a convo at a bar with girls or at a coffee shop. You do not have cold hard calculated regimens. A guy with incredible game can teach you a trick or two but you don’t *need* advice. You are socially normal.\n\nStatus: since you’re at the median it doesn’t hurt or help you. You are not a DJ, bartender, promoter, musician, gangster, or ball player. You are simply a typical guy in the environment. You are not able to push guys around with status symbols (tables, bottles, sports car).\n\nNotably, we will not let the video degrade into a debate regarding “what is more important” (IE: Looks or game, money or looks, status or money etc.) Why? It depends on who you are talking to.\n\nIf the girl is obsessed with music you are going to have a huge edge by being in a good band (status).\n\nIf the girl is a trust fund baby, you are going to have a huge edge by being attractive since she doesn’t need the money (looks)\n\nIf the girl is upper middle class and lives a boring life, your edge is going to come from entertainment/fun (game)\n\nIf the girl is dead broke and is a gold digger, you’re going to have a huge edge by being rich (money)\n\nJust don’t trust them!\n\nGet into 10% of these metrics:\nShoulders: waist x 1.6\nChest: waist x 1.4\nWaist: 43-47% of height\nArms: waist x 0.5\nLegs: match upper body\n\nAlternative Turbo version:\n\nWrist Measurement Multiplied by (Number) to Obtain Ideal Body Part Metric: \nChest:6.57x\nWaist:4.57x\nHip:5.57x\nThigh:3.43x\nBicep:2.43x\nNeck:2.43x Calves:2.29x\nForearm: 1.86x\n(get to within 85-90% of these numbers)\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS"

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\nPersonal Finance and Dating\n\nFour ways to attract girls: \n1) looks\n2) social skills – “game”\n3) relative status\n4) money\n\nThat breaks it down quite well. Instead of arguing about which one is “more important” we are going to focus on money in this video. You should always work towards maximizing all of your four categories.\nHowever. We assume you are at the *median* in the other three categories (no competitive advantage when it comes to status, looks or game. Simply the median).\n\nWhy Money Matters\n\nYou can use money to improve your looks (clothes, healthier food).\nYou can use money to hire a social skills coach (extreme situation).\nYou can use money to hire a personal trainer (fitness). \nYou can use money to elevate your relative status (owning expensive assets). \nMoney simply makes life easier.\n\nWhen you are young, girls care much less about how much money you make. They care much more about how cool you are (status). How attractive you are (looks). How funny and interesting you are (“game”). This changes at age ~23.\n\nQuick Calculations For Your Relative Dating Market Value\n\nYou need to make *at least* the median income in order to consistently date girls in the 6-7 range. If you are extremely good looking or have extremely high status (musician, DJ etc.) you can break these rules. But. Nothing else will help you if you’re below the median.\n\nGirls in the 5 and Below Range: Who cares.\n\nGirls in the 6 Range: A six is simply your type but other people wouldn’t be attracted to them. You should generate at least the median income.\n\nGirls in the 7 Range: Now you’re solidly in “cute” territory. You need to be in decent shape, have decent social skills and not be socially awkward. More importantly, since this is about money, you should generate at least 1.0-1.5x the median income to consistently get girls in the 7 range.\n\nGirls in the 8 Range: Girls in the 8 range know they are attractive. They are approached all of the time and will raise their standards yet again. You need to be in shape, decent looking and have solid social skills. You also need to generate serious amounts of cash flow to stay in the 8 range consistently. This means you need to generate at least 3.0-4.5x the median income.\n\nGirls in the 9+ Range: Anything in the “9-10” range is simply a girl everyone will say is gorgeous. These girls have an incredible amount of options. If you want to consistently compete at this level you need to generate 5-10x the median income. The range gets much wider depending on who you are.\n\nIn Short: You can calculate your worth pretty easily. If you’re doing fine in all of the three other categories and you can generate the median income… You can pick up girls in the 7 range consistently.\n\n“As long as you have two commas in your bank account… You will always be a seven” – BowTiedBull\n\nIf She Can’t Experience It, It Does Not Exist\n\nIf a girl cannot experience the money you have, it does not exist in her mind. The income requirements are based on money being *used*.\n\nLocation: As you can imagine, the median income requirements are based on *your city*. Income depends on your location.\n\nNet Worth Can Be Meaningless: If you are generating $250K+ in disposable income but spend $1K a month, you’re not going to get any girls.\n\nCreate The Experience: You leverage these hobbies into interesting experiences which can include the following: \n1) front row tickets to a concert\n2) tables directly next to the DJ\n3) large sporting events such as the Mayweather Pacquiao fight\n4) high end art events\n5) charity events where you are seen literally giving money away\n6) nice apartment/condo in the center of the city\n7) using a black car service at all times\n8) anything else you can think of. \n\nIf you don’t have a personality then you already know what to do… Get out of your comfort zone.\n\nBoring City, Limited Upside: If you live in a city that is boring and does not have much to do… You’re limiting your ability to leverage your income. If you get into the 3x median income range and find that there is no way to leverage your income… It is time to leave!\n\nIn Short: If she can’t experience it, it does not exist. If you are an 8 figure man and spend $1K a month you’re not going to obtain any leverage out of your cash flow. Find interesting hobbies and use them to meet the girls you like. If you can spend 3x the median income in your city and are not able to meet women, this is a clear sign that 1) looks, 2) social skills or 3) status needs to be raised immediately.\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS"

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\nMotivation is for the Weak\n\nSelf-doubt is normal. However. The need for motivation is for the unsuccessful. If you know someone who needs to be lifted up *emotionally* to achieve something… He never wanted it in the first place. \n\nInstead of nagging on and on about how weak people enjoy motivation (by definition they are weak because a successful person doesn’t need to be motivated) we’re going to give away a step-by-step process to rid yourself of the need for motivation. For free.\n\nStep 1 – Stand up, Walk Out: Lets assume the worst. Someone reading this likely enjoys motivational speeches and other such nonsense. Time to throw away the crutch. Kill it for good. Choose a large, large, large venue. Sit front and center. You are waiting now. Wait until the crowd bends to his words. When the crowd is bending to his words you’ll sense an uncomfortable quiet and focus from those around you. This is usually just moments before the conclusion of the speech.\n\nStand up. Slowly. Walk through the crowd. Slowly. Never look back. As people stare at you, make eye contact until they break first or you have walked past them. Head straight. Do not look down. Time will slow as you feel the scrutiny from your “peers” weighing on your shoulders. You are not doing this for the attention. Exit the venue.\n\nWhat have you done? You’ve taken control of your emotions. Congratulations. This is step one in your long journey to internal motivation.\n\nThis is certainly rude. The one-time event of learning to control your emotions is worth many thousands of dollars.\n\nStep 2 – Testing Phase: \nFind twenty-five subjects that you are interested in. Go and try all of them\nuntil you feel comfortable with the subject. It may take 4-6 months but we doubt it. You’re going to be good at some, terrible at others and have potential in *maybe* two of them. Check those two out.\n\nStep 3 – Stress Testing: Let's assume you found two topics that you have a knack for. Time to stress test. Can you do this for 80+ hours a week consistently? Try it.\n\nStep 4 – Prioritize: Now it’s time to re-prioritize your life to go all in on your newfound venture while maintaining a normal social personality. You start building based on long hours of research and effort and commit every single ounce of energy into the project until you are beat.\n\nStep 5 – Daily, Monthly and Annual Accountability: You write down your accomplishments, your failures (you’ll fail a lot!) and your future tasks every single day. Every single month. Every single year. It is up to you and only you to hold yourself accountable and compare yourself to the person you were last year.\n\nStep 6 – No One Cares About Your Career or Business: Unless the person you are meeting can potentially help you in your venture, there is no point in giving people information about your life. When you are out once or twice a week since you earned it (from all of your 12-16 hour days) leave it all behind you.\n\nStep 7 – Repeat Step 2: Once you’ve squeezed as much as you can from one venture, it is time to move to the next. Every year should be filled with interesting and new hobbies (see the attempt at 25 different activities) and ideas. If you think that the last year flew by, it means you were in a mundane routine. Do not do this.\n\nStep 8 – Bonus Sales Tip: If the masses love to be motivated and pumped up… Use motivation to sell more products and services! If you can make someone feel hyped they will bend to your beliefs and convert (convert is basic internet marketing language for purchase). It is perfectly fine to use motivation to your advantage to sell products.\n\nFrom an individual standpoint however… No one should be able to motivate you. You should be internally motivated to do well and the external motivators should be telling you to slow down if anything. People who are internally motivated have a problem of going too far. People who need external motivation have not even started in the first place.\n\nThe Bullets: \n1) go against the grain in a large environment to take control of your emotions.\n2) find what you’re good at – a long-term theme in this blog – no one can hold your hand through this process. \n3) stress test yourself intensely and find out if you can actually handle 80+ hours a week – most give up after 50. \n4) prioritize everything in your life to maximize your brain cells towards that activity. \n5) hold yourself accountable on a daily basis and have an annual review – the harshest critic should be yourself. \n6) leave all this effort behind you during down time, your brain needs to recharge and no one cares about your success. \n7) repeat step 2, most people work boring 9-5 jobs so they do not know the difference between year one and year five.\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS"

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\nInflation Solidifies the Wealthy Elite\n\nInflation: We’ve stated since early last year that the numbers are cooked and even-though they are saying it is 7.5% it is easily closer to 20%.\n\nWe’ll take an aggressive stance and say that anyone who believes 7.5% is simply not living life. Food, utilities and housing costs are all up much more than 7.5% for anyone who pays their own bills.\n\nIn simple terms, inflation means the rising cost of anything you buy. If you used to spend $100 a month on something, it will now cost you $107.5 in the following year. Scale this up and if you spend $100,000 a year in total expenses, it means next year you will be paying $107,500. All of these numbers are *after* taxes which means if you want to live the exact same life next year, you need to pull in 7.5% more money after taxes.\n\nDoesn’t That Impact Everyone the Same? Nope! That’s the entire scam. While many may read the prior paragraph and say “well everyone rich and poor has to make 7.5% more!” it simply isn’t true. The reason for this is low-interest rate debt.\n\nSimple Maths: You get the chance to borrow money at 3%. This means you can borrow say $100,000 at 3% for the next 30 years and lock in the interest rate. Sure you have to pay $3,000 a year, however, you can take that $100,000 and invest in anything that goes up with inflation over a 30-year timeframe (such as a home or even the stock market).\n\nInflation is 7.5% and your payments are 3.0% so if you simply buy an inflation hedge you *made* 4.5%. While you are borrowing money, the interest rate is so low that inflation gives you a bigger and bigger valuation. IE. You buy a home worth $1M US Token and it is now worth $1,075,000 while you paid only $30,000 in interest (probably less!)\n\nEach year asset owners get wealthier relative to the middle class (even if you are a high earning person) since wealth is not the same as income. If you’re a rich institution you can borrow more money and get a lower rate as well (how the game works). While the rich guy feels like he’s getting ahead, the mega-corporations are getting even *further* ahead.\n\nNeed for a New Financial System\n\nUntil the creation of Bitcoin (post housing crisis), there has been no alternative to the current financial system. The ideal store of value would purchase the same amount of goods and services this year as it will in 10 years. While this is practically impossible as demand for goods and services go up and down (trendy products etc.) it should be a possibility for necessities: food, water, electricity and rent.\n\nNew Economic System: If you tried to exit the current financial system… there was no alternative. In fact, if you try to protest or crowdsource money in Canada they will even block you with no civil penalties!\n\nNow? There is no excuse. You can use cryptocurrencies as an insurance policy against the constant money printing. If you think that governments will continue to print money and potentially take you out of the financial system, you need at least some insurance against that. If protecting your hard-earned money is not important to you then we don’t have time to convince you.\n\nYou don’t even need to believe in crypto to invest in it. Simply take a step back and look at how many users the industry has and ask yourself “Are users going to go up or down?” If you answered “up” then you’re forced to buy since the supply is capped. If you believe users of crypto will go *down* then you shouldn’t buy them (enjoy ze bugs!)\n\nKeeping It Simple\n\nTake a step back and ask yourself what the guiding principle was for every single good investment. It wasn’t “P/E ratio” it wasn’t “Value Investing it was the following: will more people use this?\n\nWhen Google purchased YouTube they were laughed at. Now it does around $20B in annual revenue (SEC filing page 33) and they don’t even make the videos. They guessed correctly that more and more people would be watching videos and created a monopoly around it.\n\nBack when Facebook bought WhatsApp and Instagram they were also laughed at. Once again, the herd was wrong. User growth exploded and the deals were a steal.\n\nUp To You! We know the following: 1) inflation is higher than the interest rate that rich people pay; 2) we know that more restrictions are coming - see Canada - which means your account could be locked; 3) we know that the 94% of crypto buyers are the younger generation and the boomers currently control 53% of the wealth and 4) we know that governments are printing tons of money with no way to repay it and you don’t even get to vote on it!\n\nShould you buy financial insurance? Your call anon.\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS #Crypto #Inflation"

       "description":"GET RICH WITHOUT GIVING UP YOUR LIFE: \nhttps://bit.ly/bowtied-vault\n\nSUMMARY: \nFor the long story short version here are the clear and concise bullet points, actionable steps and explanations in this video:\n\n1) No one is going to hold your hand to obtain real money. If there is real money involved, the guy would go after it himself. If someone claims that they will “teach” you how to be rich. They are full of it. This is a great sales slogan but is far far far away from reality. No one can teach you. At most they can give you guidelines. Even then… Get a legitimate mentor who is willing to spend *real time* with you.\n\n2) The basics of a business will always be the same. Find a product that people need (pain or pleasure, pain usually sells better: diet, skincare, “get rich” schemes) and drive massive amounts of traffic to the item.\n\n3) Before you get all hyped up (a term used frequently by idiots) test the product first. Throw a few grand at the targeted audience and see if it is in demand or not. If people aren’t willing to buy, move on. If people do buy… flood that market as fast as possible. Push as much traffic as possible until the long term value of the customer equals the cost of acquiring the customer. Then reassess. Remember, it’s a money making machine as long as you are generating net income.\n\n4) While it always “depends”. A typical answer for people who don’t want to answer the question. It will cost roughly $50K to start a meaningful venture. This also explains why most private equity investments require a minimum of $50K to get started and $25K is generally the number for angel investing.\n\n5) Similar to your 20s… 70%+ of your money is going to spent on making… more money. Grow or die. No other choice.\n\n6) If you are never able to sell and never able to scale… you can become “well off” but you will NEVER be rich. You need to make money in your sleep to generate real wealth.\n\n7) You don’t want to be famous. You just want to be rich. Who cares about approval from regular people? Not you. If you must become public… Good luck and much respect from this side of the web.\n\nOne little extra piece of advice… When you get to your numbers… Learn to play dumb. Be extremely dumb. Seem harmless. Only go all out when you need to go all out.\n\nUntil then? You sit, you wait, you gather information.\n\nWhen you *appear* to be following a person’s advice… They like you. Works every time.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow much does it cost to start a business?\n\nIf you’re looking at a business that you believe can generate $2 million, the start up cost is usually around $50K. There are millions of markets and the number can of course be larger or smaller.\n\n1) $10K website design/sales page (20%).\n2) $5K demand check (10%). \n3) $20-25K product manufacturing and design (50% or so).\n4) $10K miscellaneous specific items for your company.\n\nHow Much Will a Small Business Spend in a Year?\n\nSummary of 2014 Spending\n1) ~70% on Business Services.\n2) ~22% Networking/Meetings.\n3) ~6% Merchandise supplies and other.\n\nRevisiting Money for Time: \nYou will never get rich off of an annual salary or hourly wage. Ever.\n\nYou are told that salaries and hourly wages are better than commissions. Why? No one wants more competition. Especially not from someone who is bright. That is a nightmare. They want a slave.\n\nWhy You Don’t Want to Be a Public Figure: \nMost are not rich enough to understand this. It is important. Once you reach a certain net worth, the last thing you want to do is become “famous”.\n\n“Fame is harassment from regular people.” – BowTiedBull\n\nRegular people have nothing better to do with their lives than live vicariously through someone else. This is why celebrities go nuts. They are harassed every single day as people charge after their cars just to touch their shirt or skin. Lunatics.\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS #MoneyMakingMachine #OnlineBusiness"

       "description":"Most people watching this channel should focus on money. This means you need to generate revenue for a firm, obtain some equity or generate profit from *your* company. No other options. \n\nWe’re going to outline a step-by-step process for the latter… Right here. Before we do that, however, we need to explain why no one will ever\n*teach* you to be rich. \n\n1) I Will *Teach* You Be Rich! As soon as someone makes this claim you should run. No one is willing to hold your hand through a real business venture. The person is a scammer and a con artist. If he claims that he\nwants to help you “get started” what this really means is that he wants to obtain recurring revenue off of the sale. In short, you’re going to end up paying a recurring fixed cost to line his pockets. It really is that simple.\n\nIf the person is not trying to nab some fixed recurring revenue from you and he is not trying to snatch a fee by switching you over to another firm… He’s likely a poverty mindset manipulator. The last angle, usually found on personal finance blogs, is to teach you how to scrimp and save to become rich. No one gets rich this way. You learn to be a cheap fool. You’re teaching yourself that spending money is *bad*. Anyone who has made real money knows this is a terrible mindset. To make a lot of money… You must spend a lot of money.\n\nSo how do you know if you should buy the product or work with the person? Quite simple really. You do two things. You 1) buy products that provide actual actionable advice only and 2) you only work with people willing to commit a meaningful amount of time to the project (5-10 hours a week for at least 6 months). If you buy products that provide tangible value and actionable advice, you’ll never be disappointed (assuming it works).\n\n2) The Basics of a Business: Now let's take a look at what a real business is. A *real* business is something that makes money while you sleep.\n\nIt really boils down to this:\nStep 1) Find a product that people will *pay for*. If they are not willing to pay for it then it is clearly a terrible idea. You either create a brand new product category that no one has heard of or you make edits to an existing\nidea.\n\nStep 2) The assumption from step one is that the market is also large enough to generate income.\n\nStep 3) So you have both a product that people will pay for and a large enough market to generate income. How much does the product cost? You need to be certain that there is a healthy margin here.\n\nThe three steps above are all you really need to know before you even begin: 1) will people pay for this, 2) is the market large enough for me to spend my *valuable* time chasing, 3) is the margin structure healthy. If you can answer yes to all of these items, you’re rocking and rolling.\n\nNow… the obvious question is… how do I even know if step 1 works?!\n\n3) How to Determine if Demand Exists: Who are you targeting? If you cannot answer this question you do not have an idea. You have a colossal waste of time on your hands.\n\nHere is a step-by-step process on what you are going to do.\n\nStep 1) Create a solid sales page. Create the sales page first and make sure that it is *perfect*. No errors on the sales page. Videos are a plus. \n\nStep 2) Buy traffic. People who think that buying traffic is “dumb”… have never made a lot of money. Period. You buy traffic from your target group on Facebook, Google etc.\n\nStep 3) See the conversion rate. For the extreme beginners… this means how many people purchased the product? If you buy 1,000 visitors and 25 purchased, your conversion rate is 2.5%.\n\nStep 4) Recalculate your total costs and decide if the venture is worth pursuing. We titled the post money making machine for a reason. That is what you have created if the product works. The *only* equation that matters for a “money making machine” is right here:\n\nLong term value of customer – Cost of acquiring customer = Positive or Negative\n\nThat is all. Think about it this way… If you spend $10K a day to acquire customers… Does this mean anything? No. Who cares how much you spend. What matters is how much value you received from the customer over the long-term or the single point of sale. If your total expenses per day are $10K (marketing, producing the product etc.) but you generate $15K per day in revenue.. Your profit is $5K per day. You should spend more.\n\nReiteration.\n\nThis is the only thing that matters to the business. Your *total* costs simply needs to be lower than the revenue line. So long as this is the case, you spend like mad to get more customers to view your sales page. Beyond the extremely basic equation above, the real takeaway from this section is the following: stop trying to “save”. Spend as much as you like until profit margins turn break even.\n\nhttps://bowtiedbull.substack.com/subs...\nhttps://defieducation.substack.com/su...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedBull\nhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedKiwi\n\n#BANKSAREZEROS"
